Color Flipper

I created a colour flipper, by following a tutorial by John Smilga for freeCodeCamp. 
This simple project aims to change the colour of the body by clicking a button.
In the simple page it will randomly choose a value from an array, containing colours name. In the Hex page it will generate a random hex code.
I've been using html, css and javascript.
